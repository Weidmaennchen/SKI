   * Each group downloads three papers and three corresponding summaries
   * Write a review for each of the summaries
     * Work with the paper (following the steps outlined above)
     * Check whether the criteria for summaries (see below) are met by the authors
     * Summarize your findings, including
       * the parts of the summary that you liked as well as
       * the parts that require improvements in your opinion (give reasons!)
     *  Finish your review by giving three numerical ratings
       * content (1–5)
         * 5: everything stated is correct, everything important has been stated, the material is easily understandable; ... 1: major issues
       * presentation (1–5)
         * 5: clean layout, suitable structure of the text into sections and paragraphs; ... 1: major issues
