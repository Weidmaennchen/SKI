The summary is easy to read and summarizes the essential contents of the 
paper well. The indicated calculations are also very understandable. 
However, the question remains unclear why the paper has this unusual 
interesting title.
An explanation of other abbreviations like FTC is helpful. Some 
sentences in Section 2 (Summary) are very commonly formulated and rather 
remind of a literal translation from German. This could be improved.

The numerical ratings are:
Content: 4. Most of all is stated and correct, everything important has 
been stated, the material is understandable

Presentation: 4. Good structure of the text and useful sections and 
paragraphs

Language: 3. As described above, some sentences are commonly translated 
from German, so and should be revised again
