Title is the same as the paper, with the authors listed. Should be 
titled as an abstract.
Preface does not properly cover the topic and misses to get the 
essential point, that the authors discuss. Sources are not beneficial 
for understanding underlying issue of the paper. Citation style switches 
from Preface to Summary.

No/wrong citation style used in the whole summary. A lot of spelling and 
grammar mistakes, as well as unclear sentences in the first summary 
section. The summary is not really summarizing the paper, but giving 
insight into the first part of the paper. Authors are giving a lot of 
detailed information and numbers, but fail to explain what the problem 
behind over-privileged apps is. Far-reaching Insights are just listed 
and miss an explanation.

Current misbehavior of developers part fails to explain what the 
misbehavior is and why switching the permissions during usage is really 
bad. Structure of the sentences is very hard to understand.

The paperÂ´s influence part falls short on identifying why the paper is 
an important addition to the scientific community. Very debatable 
conclusion of the authors.
References are not correct. Main Paper missing. Third source by Ren et 
al. is not a website, but rather a paper in a journal.
